Hello World!

I have recently (about an hour ago from writing this) decided to make an interpreter for the language known as Brainfuck.
So following that logic I decided to make it and then start a Git repo where others may come across it themselves and learn a thing or two about how programming languages work. The entire project is made in Python3 (no reason to not work in Python2).

How to use:

$ python3 BrainFuckInterpreter.py {Your .bf file here}

That's it! Watch as your overly complicated, totally unnecessarily long program is interpreted before your very eyes!
